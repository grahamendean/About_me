# About_me

My name is Graham Endean and I am current student in the UNCC Data Boot Camp program (graduating December 2020) and I have a bachelor’s degree from East Carolina University in Communications.

I currently have 3+ years of working experience working in investigations and I am looking to jump start my career in Data Analysis. 

In my repository you will find all of my projects that I have completed in the Boot Camp where I spent 20+ hours each week perfecting each project.

•	Python
